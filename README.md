## SingletonPattern
This is a basic example of Singleton Design Pattern.

While this is just the basic implementation, the main idea behind this pattern is to create only one object and working on it.

### Idea:
When you are using an application, you only need one object to be up and running or not letting users instantiate other objects, you use this design pattern. In my example, user opens the application and in that session, user needs to create and work on that list for one time.

Or in another example when a data analyst wants to read and write to a logging file, s/he can just instantiate a singleton object and collect data on it instead of creating many files in his/her session.

## FactoryPattern
This is a basic example of Factory Design Pattern.

While this is just the basic implementation, the main idea behind this pattern is to make the project with a long-term flexibility with the help of interfaces and factory classes.

### Idea
When one needs an object without knowing the specific attributes of it, one can ask factory to create that object just by telling the factory the concept idea behind that object. Therefore one doesn't need to create an object by specificing all of its attributes. We can say that the factory acts like a knowledge center in this situation.
