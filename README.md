## FactoryPattern
This is a basic example of Factory Design Pattern.

While this is just the basic implementation, the main idea behind this pattern is to make the project with a long-term flexibility with the help of interfaces and factory classes.

### Idea:
When one needs an object without knowing the specific attributes of it, one can ask factory to create that object just by telling the factory the concept idea behind that object. Therefore one doesn't need to create an object by specificing all of its attributes. We can say that the factory acts like a knowledge center in this situation.
